**Rails CRM**
==============

UPDATE
======

Rails CRM is an opensource Customer Relations Management application.  Intended to be similiar to Paid CRM's, Rails CRM is going to be the bare bones minimum for a CRM but yet can be cloned and modified however you please.

Rails CRM uses Mongoid and Mongodb, Twitter Bootstrap, Devise for authentication, as well as HAML and SASS.  I prefer to use nosql and Mongodb is our favorite.  I looked at a few other opensource CRM's but did not find any that used mongodb.  Rails CRM became a pet project and was a starting point for one of RebelHolds interns Rick Carlino.

There is a live version on Heroku at http://demo.railscrm.com


Mongodb
========

Rails CRM uses Mongodb for its database.  You will need to have it installed to use Rails CRM.  To install mongocrm, checkout the Mongodb installation information at:

		http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/

RVM
===

Rails CRM has a .rvmrc file for specifying the Ruby version.  If you are not using RVM you should.  RVM can be installed at the command line using:

		curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby


Install
=======

	1.  git clone the repository
	2.  cd into rails_crm
	3.  accept the .rvmrc file
	4.  gem install bundler
	5.  bundle install



Approval Process
================




Work Flow
=========

This is the intended workflow:

	1. Create a Lead
	2. Create a Task for a Lead
	3. Convert Lead
		3.1 After qualifying a lead it can be converted to to contact
		3.2 During the conversion process, an Opportunity can be created
	4. Create a Contact
		4.1 These do NOT have to be a converted lead
	5. Create an Account
		5.1 An account can have many contacts and is generally the Company



Web-to-Lead
===========
Thanks to Rahul, Rails CRM now has a web-to-lead function.  With this, you can generate a web-to-lead form to put on your website which will create a new lead in Rails CRM when a visitor submits the form.

When you go to Leads and click on Web-to-Lead it brings up the form generator.

Redirect URL - This is the page that you want to redirect to after the form is submitted.  This is most likely the "Thank You" page.

Form Creation - Select the fields that you want your form to have.  At this time we do not have the ability to add a custom field so WYSIWYG.  After selecting the fields, click "Generate Form" and this will bring you to the generated form code.  Copy and paste this code on your website.


TODO
====

In addition to the stories in Pivotal Tracker, the following still need to be done:

- Add email function to leads/contacts etc (click to email)
-	Add tagging to Leads and Opportuntites.
- Create Import/Export process.
- Create standard reports TBD.
- Make the web-to-lead use the application URL
